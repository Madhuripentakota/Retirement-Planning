# Retirement-Planning
You are doing some retirement planning to make sure you have sufficient funds for retirement. You plan to retire in 15 years. You have already saved $250,000 toward retirement. Presently, you are making $100,000 per year and contributing 10% of your salary to retirement. You estimate that you will receive annual salary adjustments of 2.5% over the next 15 years and will be able to generate an 8% annual return on your investments. You feel relieved because according to your estimates, you will have over $1,100,000 at the time you retire.  But you are wondering about the impact of uncertainty on your retirement plans. While on average your raises have been 2.5%, they have been as low as 0% some years and as high as 5% other years. While average returns on your investments have been 8%, they have a lot of uncertainty with a standard deviation of 4%.  Using the spreadsheet model as a template, I build a simulation model to help investigate the impact of uncertainty on your retirement. Assume your annual salary adjustments are uniformly distributed between 0% and 5%, and that returns are normally distributed with a mean of 8% and standard deviation of 4%.
